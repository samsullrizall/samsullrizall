## Projects Experiences
### Data Visualization
#### An Interactive E-Commerce Dashboard Using Looker Studio
- A dynamic dashboard showcasing sales, customer behavior, and product performance metrics to support strategic decisions
#### Global Sales Analysis Dashboard Using Tableau 
- This project involves creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze global sales data. The dashboard provides insights into key performance metrics, including revenue, profit, sales trends, and regional performance
#### US Flight Delay Dashboard Using Tableau  
- To analyze and visualize patterns in flight delays across the United States. The dashboard is designed to provide insights into key factors contributing to delays and help identify trends in flight performance.
### Machine Learning   
#### Unveiling Salary Trends: A Data-Driven Analysis of Global Pay Scales 
- To analyze global salary data to uncover patterns and insights, including median salaries for data scientists at different experience levels, regional salary distributions, and the representativeness of adjusted salaries in specific countries. This project demonstrates theapplication of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques to address real-world business questions.
#### House Price Prediction with Machine Learning
- Utilizes various regression models, including Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to predict house prices based on relevant features.
Metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error are used for evaluation, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
#### Customer Churn Analysis
- Analyzes customer churn patterns using demographic, service, and billing data. Key factors such as tenure, contract type, payment methods, and usage of internet and streaming services are explored. Machine learning models are applied to predict churn, helping businesses improve customer retention strategies.
#### Customer Segmentation Using Mall Customer Data and RFM Analysis
- Segments mall customers by combining RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis with clustering methods like K-Means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. Key features, including age, gender, income, spending score, and purchase behavior, help identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing and improved customer engagement.
#### Water Potability Prediction
- Predicts water potability using features like pH, hardness, and contaminants. Six classifiersâ€”SVC, MLP, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNNâ€”are implemented
using Scikit-learn to ensure high accuracy in water quality classification. The final model is deployed on Streamlit, providing an interactive tool for real-time water potability
assessment.
